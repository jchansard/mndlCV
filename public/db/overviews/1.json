		"summary": "I'm a software developer who values critical thinking, testability, and usability. From C++ to JavaScript, there are a lot of tools in my toolbox; I'm a tinker at heart, and I pride myself on my capacity to find the right tool for the task. I have lived in France and Indonesia, and I speak French fluently. I'm an accomplished multitasker, able to change directions on a dime when priorities shift. As a passionate quality advocate, I hold myself to high standards. Equipped with a vast experience in SDLC and communicating with people anywhere on the development spectrum, from developers to end users, I'm able to work with anyone to achieve these standards.",
