		"summary": "I'm a software developer who values critical thinking, testability, and usability. There are a lot of tools in my toolbox; I'm a tinker at heart, and I pride myself on my capacity to find the right tool for the task. Fittingly, I'm an accomplished multitasker, able to change directions on a dime when priorities shift. As a passionate quality advocate, I hold myself to high standards; with my breadth of experience communicating with people anywhere on the development spectrum, from developers to end users, I'm able to work with anyone to achieve these standards. I always refill the coffee pot.",
